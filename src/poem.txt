"A Bird Came Down"
-Emily Dickinson
Published: 1891

A bird came down the walk:
He did not know I saw;
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.

And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass,
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
To let a beetle pass.

He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroad,--
They looked like frightened beads, I thought;
He stirred his velvet head

Like one in danger; cautious,
I offered him a crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home

Than oars divide the ocean,
Too silver for a seam,
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
Leap, splashless, as they swim.

"A poem about everything but the bird in 'A Bird Came Down' by Emily Dickinson"
-ChatGPT

Beneath the canvas of the open sky,
A garden blooms where life draws nigh.
In verdant realms where shadows play,
Nature weaves its intricate display.

The sun, a golden artist's brush,
Paints the world in hues so lush.
Whispers of the wind in trees,
Compose a symphony with gentle ease.

Upon the stage, the flowers dance,
Their petals waltzing in a sunlit trance.
In dew-kissed robes of morning's light,
They twirl and shimmer, pure and bright.

A babbling brook with liquid song,
Threads its journey, meandering along.
Carving tales in earth and stone,
A timeless melody, a rhythm unknown.

Butterflies, like strokes of living paint,
Flutter by, a delicate restraint.
Their vibrant wings in patterns unfold,
A fleeting beauty, a story untold.

The grass beneath my wandering feet,
A carpet green, where life's pulses beat.
Tiny creatures in the soil's embrace,
Shape the earth with subtle grace.

Clouds above, a shifting dream,
In billowed masses, a spectral gleam.
The canvas vast, a cosmic art,
Where constellations play their part.

So, in the garden of this earthly maze,
Life unfurls in a myriad of ways.
In every breath and rustling leaf,
A universe of wonders, beyond belief.
